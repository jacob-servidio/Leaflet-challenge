Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet

United States Geological Survey, or USGS, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

Build a new set of tools that will allow the USGS to visualize their earthquake data. The USGS collects a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.
